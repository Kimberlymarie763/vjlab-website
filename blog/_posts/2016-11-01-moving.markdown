I am excited to announce that the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Dynamics has moved to the [Biomedicine Discovery Institute](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute) at  [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu), Melbourne. 

We are currently recruiting *Research Fellows* at the postdoctoral level with training and experience in sequencing and computational biology to study the evolutionary genomics of infectious diseases. We are also recruiting *Research Assistants* to manage and assist in diagnostics of viral and bacterial pathogens, pcr and sequencing, and data curation and management.
