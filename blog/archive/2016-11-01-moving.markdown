We are currently recruiting *Research Fellows* at the postdoctoral level with training and experience in [phylodynamics](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syw054) to study the dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses. We are also recruiting *Research Assistants* to manage and assist in diagnostics of viral and bacterial pathogens, PCR and sequencing, and data curation and management.
