title:  Moving to Monash University!
author: Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran

There has been exciting change in my career. I have now moved to [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu) in Melbourne as an Associate Professor. The biggest change is that my office and lab will be located in the Division of Immunity and Infection at the [Biomedicine Discovery Institute](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute), but I am also part of the [Department of Microbiology](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/microbiology/) in the School of Biological Sciences. I believe such a two-tiered system will provide the best of both worlds: the new 'Division' system engages scientists from several departments working in a generally similar area and focus, whereas the older system offers a sense of belonging with similar expertises working on different areas.
