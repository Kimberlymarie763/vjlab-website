I am currently working towards completing my Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Science majoring in Business Analytics and Microbiology. My interests lie in population health and epidemiology of infectious diseases, as well as learning how to apply data manipulation methods to these datasets.

As an undergraduate research student in the Virus Evolution Lab, I will be looking at the phylodynamic patterns of Influenza A/H3N2 in Australia. My project will be exploring whether there is a correlation between genetic diversity, disease severity, and R0.
