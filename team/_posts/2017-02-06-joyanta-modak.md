I completed my PhD (2017) in the department of Microbiology, Monash University, Australia. My PhD research was highly interdisciplinary and I was trained at the interface of microbiology, biochemistry and structural biology. My work focused on the virulence of the carcinogenic bacterium _Helicobacter pylori,_ with a view to better understand the basic biology of this pathogen in the context of host-pathogen interactions, and to identify novel potential targets for drug design.  

My research as a Research Fellow will focus on identification of viral aetiologies that cause acute respiratory infections and conduct genetic, epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis to test specific hypothesis on disease severity, molecular epidemiology and transmission patterns.
