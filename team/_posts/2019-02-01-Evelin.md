I am working towards completing my Bachelor of Medical Science with a Major in Biomedicine at Karolinska Institutet
in Sweden and currently I am at Monash University as an exchange student doing a major undergraduate research project at the Virus Evolution Lab. My interests lie in the field of Microbiology, particularly the epidemiology of infectious diseases.
My research project will be direct RNA sequencing of the Influenza A, B, C and Human Respiratory virus genomes using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform in order to characterize the genomes, which could aid in understanding the viral properties that can aid the annual seasonal influenza vaccine selection process...
