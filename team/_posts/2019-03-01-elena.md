I am currently completing my Honours in Biomedical Science at Monash University. I am interested in the evolution and epidemiology of infectious diseases. My project focuses on the changing ecology of rotavirus in Australia. This project aims to show the evolutionary pattern of a rotavirus strain in Australia over several years and will involve using patient samples for next generation sequencing and assembly of phylogenetic trees.
