I am currently undertaking a Diploma in Biotechnology in Temasek Polytechnic and have been involved in projects utilizing PCR to detect Salmonella sp. in raw chicken samples, and in the interpretation of data from real-time PCR to determine the effect of temperature on the expression of the FLP gene in an unknown nosocomial pathogen.
