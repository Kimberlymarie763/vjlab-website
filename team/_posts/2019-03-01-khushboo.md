Having completed my Bachelor of Biomedical Science with a major in Infections and Immunity from Deakin University in 2018, I am now working towards completing my Biomedicine Honours year in the Department of Microbiology, Monash University.
My project involves sequencing the viral genome from a range of significantly prevalent respiratory viruses (e.g. Influenza and RSV) using NGS.
This will help gain a better understanding of what genetic factors enable some strains to be more or less infectious than the others.
Career wise, I aim to work my way through to a PhD and build a career in researching infections and immunity.
Personally, I really enjoy reading, listening to music and spending time outdoors.
