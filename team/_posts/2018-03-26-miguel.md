I obtained my degree in Computer Systems Engineering and a MSc in Bioinformatics in Spain. After several years designing tools to facilitate researchersâ€™ work related with photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices for Physics Department at the University Jaume I (https://www.uji.es/), I decided to go to Japan to be part of the Ecology and Evolution Unit in 2013 at OIST (https://www.oist.jp/) where I was working in several projects, designing NGS pipelines for a variety of organisms during four years.
I arrived to the Virus Evolution Unit in 2017. We are focused in the study of distinct virus, e.g. influenza and polio, through the last NGS techniques, which is really exciting. My interest in this field grows up as I read and learn more.

On a personal level, I love travelling and discovering new cultures. I really like reading/writing and spend time with friends, music, games and cinema.
