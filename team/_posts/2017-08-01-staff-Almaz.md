I am currently completing the placement year of my Masters in Biomedicine and Health Sciences at Monash University. I previously completed my Bachelor of Science, majoring in Microbiology and Immunology, and have a keen interest in understanding the host-pathogen interactions that occur during infection and disease.

During my research in the Virus Evolution Lab, I aim to develop a set of completely new skills in the field of bioinformatics, whilst continuing to understand the complex interplay between viral pathogens and the host immune system.
