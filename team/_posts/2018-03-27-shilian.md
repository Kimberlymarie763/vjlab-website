I obtained my master degree in Applied Mathematics (Nonlinear dynamical System and Chaos Theory) in Zhejiang Normal University, China. In my undergraduate study, I won 2nd place in the 12th _Challenge Cup_ National Undergraduate Curricular Academic Science and Technology Competition (China); During my master research, I won the 3rd place in the 13th _Challenge Cup_ National Undergraduate Curricular Academic Science and Technology Competition (China) and 2nd place in the 10th _Huawei Cup_ National Postgraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (China). Then, I studied in Weimzann Institute of Science(Israel) as the visiting student. After arriving Vijay Lab, my research is centered to employ both mathematical models and biological experiments to investigate the evolution of Influenza virus under host immunity.
