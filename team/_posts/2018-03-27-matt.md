I am currently in my third year of the Bachelor of Biomedical Science at Monash University, and have taken up a research project in the Virus Evolution Lab for the first half of 2018. The research I will be undertaking concerns the application of NGS methods in the identification of vaccine-derived poliovirus.

Microbiology is a passion of mine, particularly when it comes to research of medical significance, and I look forward to furthering my knowledge of the discipline from a bioinformatics perspective.

Outside of university I enjoy reading and playing chess.
