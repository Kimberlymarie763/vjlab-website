 I have a Bachelors degree in Pharmacy from Hyderabad, in southern India. I am interested in science, travelling and hiking. I am currently a Monash Master of Biomedical and Health Science student. My Masters research project is to understand the within-host genomic evolution of influenza under various growth conditions.
