 My name is Yeshwanth Reddy. I am from Hyderabad which is located in southern part of India. I did my bachelors degree in pharmacy. Apart from science my interests are in travelling and hiking with friends. I am doing my research project under the supervision of Assoc.Professor. Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran. My research project is mainly based on understanding how Influenza virus is evolving within the host by using computational tools.
