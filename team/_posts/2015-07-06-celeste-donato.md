I am currently a NHMRC Peter Doherty early career research fellow based within the [Vijay lab](http://www.vjlab.io/) at Monash University. I have a major interest in using next generation sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analyses to characterise viruses that cause significant paediatric morbidity and mortality; as well as viruses associated with zoonotic transmission. I completed a Biomedical Science degree (Hons) at La Trobe University and was awarded an Australian Postgraduate Award to complete my PhD in the Enteric Disease Group, [Murdoch Children's Research Institute](https://www.mcri.edu.au/research/themes/infection-and-immunity/enteric-diseases). My PhD investigated the changing epidemiology of rotavirus strains in Australia following the universal introduction of paediatric rotavirus vaccines, and was recognized with a [Nancy Millis medal](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/researchers/grs/hdr/thesis-submission/nancy-millis-award). I have a NHMRC-funded project commencing in 2019 entitled “Is vaccine-induced herd immunity altering the diversity of rotavirus strains in Australia” combining cutting-edge phylogenetic and antigenic analyses to describe rotavirus evolution.
