I am currently a NHMRC Peter Doherty early career research fellow investigating the genomic evolution and epidemiology of Rotaviruses. Based within the [Vijay lab](http://www.vjlab.io/) at Monash University, I have a major interest and focus on viruses that cause significant paediatric morbidity and mortality; as well as viruses associated with zoonotic transmission. I completed a Biomedical Science degree (Hons) at La Trobe University and was awarded an Australian Postgraduate Award to complete my PhD at La Trobe University under the supervision of A/Prof Carl Kirkwood in the Enteric Virus Group, [Murdoch Children's Research Institute](https://www.mcri.edu.au/), Melbourne, Australia. My PhD investigated the changing epidemiology of rotavirus strains in Australia following the universal introduction of paediatric rotavirus vaccines, and was recognized with a [Nancy Millis medal](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/researchers/grs/hdr/thesis-submission/nancy-millis-award).
