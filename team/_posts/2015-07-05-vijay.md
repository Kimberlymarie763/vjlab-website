I completed my PhD in Microbial Evolution and Systematics (2005) at the Department of Ecology and Biodiversity,[The University of Hong Kong](http://hku.hk/), and then spent 4 years doing post-doctoral research at the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at [HKU](http://hku.hk/).
I moved to Singapore in 2010 to take up a Faculty position at [Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/). My first task at Singapore was to establish the Influenza Evolution program in collaboration with [Dr. Gavin Smith](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/content/smith-gavin-jd).
I currently lead a group in [Virus Evolution](virusevolution.monash.edu) at the [Biomedicine Discovery Institute](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute), where we conduct genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analysis to understand the factors that affect pathogen diversity in humans and animals.
