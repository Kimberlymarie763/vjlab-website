I completed my PhD in Microbial Evolution and Systematics (2005) at the Department of Ecology and Biodiversity and then spent 4 years doing post-doctoral research at the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at [The University of Hong Kong](http://hku.hk/).
I moved to Singapore in 2010 to take up a Faculty position at [Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/). My first task at Singapore was to establish the Influenza Evolution program in collaboration with [Dr. Gavin Smith](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/content/smith-gavin-jd).
Since 2015, I have lead the [Laboratory of Infectious Disease Dynamics](vjlab.io) where we conduct genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analysis to understand the factors that affect pathogen diversity in humans and animals.
