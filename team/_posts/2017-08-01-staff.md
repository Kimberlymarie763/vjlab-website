I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Biotechnology at Temasek Polytechnic. My three years at polytechnic have equipped me with a wide range of skills in Molecular Biology, Microbiology and Genomics & Proteomics, amongst several other fields. Furthermore, I have specialized in Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, which included Pharmacology as an additional elective. I have also taken part in multiple research projects, pertaining to the thermostabilization of user-friendly isothermal amplification assays as well as the creation of all-organic multi-pest repellents.

I have a keen interest in Immunology, Pathology and Vaccine Production. As an intern in the Laboratory of Infectious Disease Dynamics at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, I hope to broaden my skills and knowledge in these areas.
