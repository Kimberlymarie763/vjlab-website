I am currently completing a Master of Biomedical and Health Science and am interested in infectious disease epidemiology. My project will involve using next generation sequencing and molecular phylogenetics to observe genetic evolution of Hepatitis C virus in injecting drug users with the aim of inferring viral transmission networks. This project will be completed in collaboration with the Burnet Institute as part of their Eliminate Viral Hepatitis program and may help to guide future treatment and public health measures.
