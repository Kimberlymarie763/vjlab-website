## Laboratory of Infectious Disease Dynamics
Our research focuses on the evolution, epidemiology, and immunology of viral diseases that infect animals and humans. We conduct infectious disease surveillance, generate genomic data, conduct phylogenetic analysis and perform pathogen evolution related experimental work to understand the factors that determine pathogen diversity.
