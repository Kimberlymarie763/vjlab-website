# Abstract
Genetic analysis of sequence data is central to determining the evolutionary history and molecular epidemiology of viruses, particularly those such as influenza A virus that have complex ecosystems involving multiple hosts. Here we provide an outline of routine phylogenetic analyses of influenza A viruses including multiple sequence alignment, selecting the best-fit evolutionary model and phylogenetic tree reconstruction using Neighbor joining, Maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference.
