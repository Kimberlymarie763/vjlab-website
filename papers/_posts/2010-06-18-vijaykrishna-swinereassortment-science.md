# Abstract

The emergence of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza demonstrated that pandemic viruses could be generated in swine.
Subsequent reintroduction of H1N1/2009 to swine has occurred in multiple countries.
Through systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in swine from a Hong Kong abattoir, we characterize a reassortant progeny of H1N1/2009 with swine viruses.
Swine experimentally infected with this reassortant developed mild illness and transmitted infection to contact animals.
Continued reassortment of H1N1/2009 with swine influenza viruses could produce variants with transmissibility and altered virulence for humans.
Global systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in swine is warranted.
